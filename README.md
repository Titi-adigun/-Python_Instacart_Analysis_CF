# Python_Instacart_Analysis_CF
Analysis of Instacart Grocery Basket to identify sales pattern using Python. This project is part of the careerfoundry Data Analytics course.


Instacart is a North American online grocery store that operates through an app. Although the company has being making good sales, they want to gain more insights about their sales pattern to segment their customers based on their profiles. Also, they want to create personalized marketing campaigns and observe the effects this would have on the products.
My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
